        <h2>MY FAMILY</h2>
        <p>My family consists of my Mom, Dad, and younger brother. My father was born in Argentina and moved to the US when he was around 3 years old. My mother was born in Illinois. My father works full time and often travels and my mother often takes my little brother and I everywhere, mainly to our soccer practices. We only have one pet which is our dog, Scout.</p>

        <h2>HOBBIES AND INTERESTS</h2>
        <p>I like to play video games such as Call of Duty and Fortnite with my friends. I also enjoy drawing and painting as well as graphic design in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop on the computer. When I was younger I played piano but have recently started playing guitar instead. I used to go to karate but after a some time I gave it up because everyday I had somewhere to be and I was really worn out. I love to play soccer with my friends and have played on a few different club teams. I have played soccer since I was 4 years old, this is thanks to my Dad and my grandpa who watch soccer whenever possible. I spend a lot of time watching TV shows like the Flash, Arrow, DC's Legends of Tomorrow and watching comedy videos on youtube.</p>
